    "description": "IT Staffing agencies maintain an active talent pool which allows them to scout talent quickly. When a company loses employees it’s important that those positions are not only replaced by qualified individuals but those positions also need to be replaced quickly so that the workload doesn’t become too heavy for the existing employees. Plus staffing agencies carefully interview prospects to gain as much knowledge as possible and make good placements. Besides IT Staffing agencies absorb the cost of the initial stages of a new hire. They often conduct the background checks and even do part of if not all of the training. This can save your company a ton of money. Plus, if an employee turns out not to be a good fit, many staffing agencies guarantee a replacement employee. Not only does this process save time, it saves money and allows your company to continue to be productive even if the hiring process is not complete and your company lacks permanent employees. You are given the staff you need, even if the employees remain temporary hires. Your productivity is not interrupted because there are employees in place to do the job.",

    "title": "What is a business?",
    "description": "The term business describes any activity that involves the provision of a product or service to consumers. These items may be tangible, such as cars or soda, or they may be intangible, such as software or services. Business activities can range from providing electricity or water to services like advertising or providing warehouse space. However, whatever the type of business, it must be run in a way that makes customers happy. Listed below are the main components of a business. Every business involves a profit motive. The reason why people engage in business activities is to earn profit and accumulate wealth. It is important to note that higher prices and higher satisfaction of consumers are indicators of higher profits and higher satisfaction. But these factors are only a part of business success. Fortunately, a variety of business forms exist, from small, home-based businesses to massive corporations with hundreds of employees. In any case, business is a great way to generate revenue and contribute to society. A business primarily involves the production of goods and services for profit. It cannot be a non-profit organization. A business requires regular transactions between buyers and sellers of goods and services. Therefore, it is imperative that the activities of a business are consistent. Even a one-time transaction is not sufficient to qualify as a business. If, however, the business deals with the same products and services on a regular basis, then it will be considered a business.",

    "title": "What are the 9 key features for an e-recruitment system for engineering services?",
    "description": "Nowadays recruitment software has to meet many requirements. Whenever a company decides to select a new system there are different groups of interest involved: e.g. recruiters, business managers, IT and management departments. Therefore software manufacturers often see themselves confronted with complex requests and specification sheets that hardly any system can fulfill within a reasonable budget range. So exactly which qualities does an e-recruitment system have to possess to enable the recruiters and business managers to work efficiently? 1. User-friendly. A recruitment system is a complex application that has to be intuitive for the users. The handling has to be clear with a logical allocation of the functionalities in order to increase the user acceptance and productivity. The use of modern web technologies in the software architecture is a precondition, too. 2. Web-based. In any case, an up-to-date system should be web-based. Whereas it doesn’t really matter whether the data is hosted on a server of the client (On premise) or of the supplier (SaaS/Software as a service). The access of all employees to a centralized database enables the usage from different locations. The software can then also be maintained and updated more regularly. 3. Multi-Channel-Posting One of the recruiters’ main activities is the publishing of job offers on various online job portals to obtain the maximum reach. The central handling of the job board logins directly from the system makes the function of multi-channel-posting easy-to-handle and helps to save precious time. 4. CV Parsing. CV parsing is the automatic scanning of candidate data. Applications can be directly extracted, modified and evaluated. Like this the HR employees gain lots of time when inserting data. Furthermore the number of errors resulting from the manual insertion decreases. 5. Matching. The matching between the candidates and the customers’ needs is one of the essential processes for engineering services. It is crucial that the relevant competencies are recognized and considered within the search. A dynamic catalogue of competences that contains different specific keywords as well as synonyms and other spellings and other translations can bring a major advantage. 6. Talent pool. Any position can be staffed with only one candidate. Though this does not necessarily imply that the other applicants do not represent precious human capital. In times where you have to talk about the “war of talents” with a decreasing number of candidates for the number of jobs to be staffed this potential should not be given away with a negative answer. Instead you can transfer them into a talent pool – with their consent, of course. Like this they can be reconsidered for later vacancies. Here it makes sense to use the recruitment software rather like a CRM to establish a regular contact with the pool members.",

    "description": "Search engines such as Google and Bing use bots to crawl pages on the web, going from site to site, collecting information about those pages and putting them in an index. Think of the index like a giant library where a librarian can pull up a book (or a web page) to help you find exactly what you’re looking for at the time. Next, algorithms analyze pages in the index, taking into account hundreds of ranking factors or signals, to determine the order pages should appear in the search results for a given query. In our library analogy, the librarian has read every single book in the library and can tell you exactly which one will have the answers to your questions. Our SEO success factors can be considered proxies for aspects of the user experience. It’s how search bots estimate exactly how well a  website or web page can give the searcher what they’re searching for. ",
